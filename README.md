# InformationSecurity
A group of small tasks from Information Security

**CaesarCipher.py** contains both encryption and decryption of a string. Both string and key are given by the user.

**CaesarBruteForce.py** is a demonstration of a brute force attack on a Caesar cypher. The ciphertext is given, but it is checking for any possible key. There is also shown a different way of codding the encryption and decryption of the cypher.

**passCrack.py** is attack on numerical passwords of four digits (such as ATMs codes for credit cards). User gives the real password, and the program, cracks it.We use the processing time as a vulnerability.
